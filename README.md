# BioinformaticsSnackTime


This is a little collection of unix commands, bash onlines, and information on the usage of bioinformatics tools for my favourite working group ;)
It is all centered around working with microbial sequencing data, both amplicon and shotgun, in a Linux environment.

Open the respective `.md` files to see session notes
